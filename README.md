I created these codes to familiarise myself with the nature of hyperbolic PDEs. Most of the numerical schemes can be found in the textbook  'Numerical methods for conservation laws' by Randall Leveque

In the code, the user is allowed to choose various numerical schemes and initial conditions.

Numerical Schemes:
1. Lax-Friedrichs
2. Lax-Wendroff
3. Ritchymyer
4. MarCormack

Initial Condition:
1. Gaussian
2. N Function
3. Inverted N Function
4. Staircase
